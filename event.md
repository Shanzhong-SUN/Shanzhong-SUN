* 为促进国内研究天体力学相关课题之数学家、天文学家与物理学家间的交流与合作，藉以提升国内天体力学之研究水平，与台湾清华大学数学系的陈国璋教授和南京紫金山天文台的傅燕宁教授于2019年共同发起了“[天体力学数学理论研讨会](https://mathcelemech.github.io/conference/)”。

* 自2017年始，每年为大学一年级的学生作科普报告一次，题目涉及：万有引力定律（2017）、神奇的星环（2018）、集异璧（2019）、数学的统一性--从图谈起（2020）、收敛与发散级数（2021）、指数函数（2022）。

* 讨论班报告
    
    * 2022/10/19: 王维佳 (清华大学), Modular Regulator and Special Double L-values（In 2006, Manin introduced and studied multiple L-functions of cusp forms but currently not many multiple L-values are well-understood. Beilinson (1986) defined the Eisenstein symbol in the motivic cohomology of the universal elliptic curve and the work of Deninger–Scholl (1989) shows the Petersson inner product of its regulator gives us L-values. In this talk I will present how to relate this modular regulator with double L-values and iterated integrals of Eisenstein series.）
    * 2022/11/30: 束红非（BIMSA），TBA/WKB correspondence and Resurgent Quantum Mechanics （In this talk, we derive a system of thermodynamics Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations governing the exact WKB periods in one-dimensional Quantum Mechanics with arbitrary polynomial potentials. These TBA equations provide a solution to the Riemann-Hilbert problem of WKB periods in resurgent Quantum Mechanics. Combined with the exact quantization condition, our TBA equations provide a powerful method to solve the spectral problem. If time allows, we will also mention recent achievements on the higher order ODE.）
    * 2023/03/08: 王智拓（哈尔滨工业大学数学研究院），  Construction Renormalization of the two dimensional Grosse-Wulkenhaar model（The Grosse-Wulkenaar model is a non-integrable matrix model with quartic interaction. It is the first renormalizable model in non-commutative quantum field theory and is closely related to the Kontsevich model for the study of the two dimensional quantum gravity. In this talk I will present some results about the construction of the two-dimensional Grosse-Wulkenhaar model with renormalization group analysis.）
    *  2023/03/28：周贝加（北京大学），Fredholm Theory for Real Pseudoholomorphic Curves in Symplectization （In the symplectization of a contact manifold, people can consider the Symplectic Field Theory (SFT) in all odd dimensions and Embedded Contact Homology (ECH) in dimension 3. Because there is Real Gromov-Witten Theory and Real Seiberg-Witten Theory, it is a natural idea that Real SFT and Real ECH should exist. The first step to construct those theories is to get Fredholm index for moduli space of real pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectization. By this formula of Fredholm index, we can get parallel index inequalities for real pseudoholomorphic curves as in ECH, which is crucial to define Real ECH. I will give and explain the formula of Fredholm index and index inequalities. Other parts of the project of define Real SFT and Real ECH will be mentioned as well.）
