### About me

I graduated from [Chern Institute of Mathematics](http://www.cim.nankai.edu.cn), Nankai University, Tianjin and got my PhD degree in 2001.

I spent two years from 2001 to 2003 at School of Mathematical Sciences, Pekin University as postdoc.

Then I joined Capital Normal University in 2003 as a faculty member of Department of Mathematics.

Here is my CV (to be added).

### [Research](https://shanzhong-sun.github.io/ShanzhongSUN/research)


My research interests lie at the crossroads of mathematics and physics, and I work on such topics as N-body problem in celestial mechanics, Fukaya category in symplectic topology, semiclassical trace formula and resurgence theory. 

More precisely, I am interested in 

* Symplectic Geometry and Symplectic Topology: symplectic reduction; Floer homologies and Fukaya categories; quiver varieties; cluster varieties; singularities from symplectic perspective

* Hamiltonian Systems and Celestial Mechanics: Maslov index; N-body problem (stability; central configurations; periodic orbits); Gutzwiller’s semiclassical trace formula; (algebraic) completely integrable Hamiltonian systems (ACIS) and their interactions with geometry and physics
 
* Mathematical Physics: higher structures (homotopical algebras, higher categories,...) behind quantum mechanics and quantum field theory; semiclassical/deformation quantization; modularity; gauge theory;  

* Resurgence Theory and Mould Calculus à la Écalle with applications in mathematics (BCH, MZV, modularity...) and quantum physics (wall-crossing, Écalle-Voros exact WKB analysis, complex Chern-Simons theory...)

题目：Modular regulator and special double L-values
摘要：In 2006, Manin introduced and studied multiple L-functions of cusp forms but currently not many multiple L-values are well-understood.  Beilinson (1986) defined the Eisenstein symbol in the motivic cohomology of the universal elliptic curve and the work of Deninger–Scholl (1989) shows the Petersson inner product of its regulator gives us L-values. In this talk I will present how to relate this modular regulator with double L-values and iterated integrals of Eisenstein series.
