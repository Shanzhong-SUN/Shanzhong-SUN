### [Research](https://shanzhong-sun.github.io/ShanzhongSUN/research)


My research interests lie at the crossroads of mathematics and physics and I work on such topics as N-body problem in celestial mechanics, Fukaya category in symplectic topology, semiclassical trace formula and resurgence theory. 

More precisely, I am interested in 

* Symplectic Geometry and Symplectic Topology: symplectic reduction; Floer homologies and Fukaya categories; quiver varieties; cluster varieties; singularities 

* Hamiltonian Systems and Celestial Mechanics: Maslov index; N-body problem (stability; central configurations; periodic orbits); Gutzwiller’s semiclassical trace formula; integrability 
 
* Mathematical Physics: higher structures (homotopical algebras) behind quantum mechanics and quantum field theory;
