### About me

I graduated from [Chern Institute of Mathematics](http://www.cim.nankai.edu.cn), Nankai University, Tianjin and got my PhD degree in 2001.

I spent two years from 2001 to 2003 at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University as postdoc.

Then I joined Capital Normal University in 2003 as a faculty member of Department of Mathematics.

Here is my CV (to be added).

### [Research](https://shanzhong-sun.github.io/ShanzhongSUN/research)


My research interests lie at the crossroads of mathematics and physics, and I work on such topics as N-body problem in celestial mechanics, Fukaya category in symplectic topology, semiclassical trace formula and resurgence theory. 

More precisely, I am interested in 

* Symplectic Geometry and Symplectic Topology: symplectic reduction; Floer homologies and Fukaya categories; quiver varieties; cluster varieties; singularities from symplectic perspective

* Hamiltonian Systems and Celestial Mechanics: Maslov index; N-body problem (stability; central configurations; periodic orbits); Gutzwiller’s semiclassical trace formula; (algebraic) completely integrable Hamiltonian systems (ACIS) and their interactions with geometry and physics
 
* Mathematical Physics: higher structures (homotopical algebras, higher categories,...) behind quantum mechanics and quantum field theory; quantization (semiclassical, deformation quantization, BV, brane quantization...); modularity; gauge theory; Feynman diagrams  

* Resurgence Theory and Mould Calculus à la Écalle with applications in mathematics (BCH, MZV, modularity...) and quantum physics (wall-crossing, Écalle-Voros exact WKB analysis, complex Chern-Simons theory, topological string theory...)

    > 题目：Positive Scalar Curvature: Existence and Rigidity
    > 
    > 摘要：The scalar curvature of a Riemannian metric is interesting not only in analysis, geometry, and topology, but also in physics. Enlargeable Length-structures will be introduced and showed that it is a new obstruction to the existence of a Riemannian metric with positive scalar curvature (PSC-metric). Thus, the connected sum of a closed manifold with some of locally CAT(0)-manifolds carry not PSC-metrics. We will also show that almost non-positive curved manifolds carry no PSC-metrics.  On the other hand, harmonic maps with condition C will be used to show the rigidity theorem about the scalar curvature.

    > 
    > 摘要： In this talk, I will present the basic constructions about the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles on Deligne-Mumford curves. To conclude, I will explicitly discrible the moduli space of rank 2 Higgs bundles on the pillowcase orbifold curve.
