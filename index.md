### About me

I graduated from [Chern Institute of Mathematics](http://www.cim.nankai.edu.cn), Nankai University, Tianjin and got my PhD degree in 2001.

I spent two years from 2001 to 2003 at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University as postdoc.

Then I joined Capital Normal University in 2003 as a faculty member of Department of Mathematics.

Here is my CV (to be added).

### [Research](https://shanzhong-sun.github.io/ShanzhongSUN/research)


My research interests lie at the crossroads of mathematics and physics, and I work on such topics as N-body problem in celestial mechanics, Fukaya category in symplectic topology, semiclassical trace formula and resurgence theory. 

More precisely, I am interested in 

* Symplectic Geometry and Symplectic Topology: symplectic reduction; Floer homologies and Fukaya categories; quiver varieties; cluster varieties; singularities from symplectic perspective

* Hamiltonian Systems and Celestial Mechanics: Maslov index; N-body problem (stability; central configurations; periodic orbits); Gutzwiller’s semiclassical trace formula; (algebraic) completely integrable Hamiltonian systems (ACIS) and their interactions with geometry and physics
 
* Mathematical Physics: higher structures (homotopical algebras, higher categories,...) behind quantum mechanics and quantum field theory; quantization (semiclassical, deformation quantization, BV, brane quantization...); modularity; gauge theory; Feynman diagrams  

* Resurgence Theory and Mould Calculus à la Écalle with applications in mathematics (BCH, MZV, modularity...) and quantum physics (wall-crossing, Écalle-Voros exact WKB analysis, complex Chern-Simons theory, topological string theory...)

    > 题目：Automorphisms of the Boutet de Monvel algebra
    > 
    > 摘要：In a remarkable work, Duistermaat and Singer in 1976 studied the algebras  of all classical pseudodifferential operators on smooth (boundaryless)  manifolds. They  gave a description of  order preserving algebra isomorphism  between  the algebras of classical pseudodifferential operators of two manifolds. The subject of this talk is the generalisation of their results to manifolds with boundary. The role of the algebra of pseudodifferential operators that we are interested in is the  Boutet de Monvel algebra. 
The main fact of life about manifold with boundary is that vector fields do not define global flows and the "boundary conditions" are a way of dealing with this problem. The Boutet de Monvel algebra
corresponds to the choice of local boundary conditions and is, effectively,  a non-commutative completion of the manifold. One can think of  it as a parametrised version of the classical Toeplitz
algebra as a completion of the half-space.
What appears in the study of automorphisms are Fourier integraloperators and we will try to explain their appearance - both in boundaryless and boundary case. as it turns out, the non-trivial boundary case introduces both some complications but also some simplifications of the analysis involved, Once this is done, the analysis that we need reduces to a high degree to relatively classical results about automorphisms and homology of the Toeplitz algebra and some basic facts from K-theory.
This is a joint work in progress with Elmar Schrohe.
