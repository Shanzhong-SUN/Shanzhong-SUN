### About me

I graduated from [Chern Institute of Mathematics](http://www.cim.nankai.edu.cn), Nankai University, Tianjin and got my PhD degree in 2001.

I spent two years from 2001 to 2003 at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University as postdoc.

Then I joined Capital Normal University in 2003 as a faculty member of Department of Mathematics.

Here is my CV (to be added).

### [Research](https://shanzhong-sun.github.io/ShanzhongSUN/research)


My research interests lie at the crossroads of mathematics and physics, and I work on such topics as N-body problem in celestial mechanics, Fukaya category in symplectic topology, semiclassical trace formula and resurgence theory. 

More precisely, I am interested in 

* Symplectic Geometry and Symplectic Topology: symplectic reduction; Floer homologies and Fukaya categories; quiver varieties; cluster varieties; singularities from symplectic perspective

* Hamiltonian Systems and Celestial Mechanics: Maslov index; N-body problem (stability; central configurations; periodic orbits); Gutzwiller’s semiclassical trace formula; (algebraic) completely integrable Hamiltonian systems (ACIS) and their interactions with geometry and physics
 
* Mathematical Physics: higher structures (homotopical algebras, higher categories,...) behind quantum mechanics and quantum field theory; quantization (semiclassical, deformation quantization, BV, brane quantization...); modularity; gauge theory; Feynman diagrams  

* Resurgence Theory and Mould Calculus à la Écalle with applications in mathematics (BCH, MZV, modularity...) and quantum physics (wall-crossing, Écalle-Voros exact WKB analysis, complex Chern-Simons theory, topological string theory...)

    > 题目：Langlands Dualities through Bethe/Gauge Correspondence for 3d Gauge Theories
    > 
    > 摘要：For non-simple laced Lie algebras, B_N and C_N are Langlands dual to each other in mathematical. In this article, we give two kinds of uniform realizations of Bethe/Gauge correspondence between 3d (or 2d) classical Lie group supersymmetry gauge theory with closed and open XXZ (or XXX) spin chain, the role of the ADE Lie algebras are self-dual, and the non-simple laced Lie algebras BN and CN, their position is exchanged. From Bethe/Gauge correspondence point of view, the two types of the effective superpotentials are Langlands duality to each other. More fantastically, for BN-type Lie algebra, fixed spin site by a boundary through Bethe/Gauge.
