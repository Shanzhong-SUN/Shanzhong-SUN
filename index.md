### About me

I graduated from [Chern Institute of Mathematics](http://www.cim.nankai.edu.cn), Nankai University, Tianjin and got my PhD degree in 2001.

I spent two years from 2001 to 2003 at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University as postdoc.

Then I joined Capital Normal University in 2003 as a faculty member of Department of Mathematics.

Here is my CV (to be added).

### [Research](https://shanzhong-sun.github.io/ShanzhongSUN/research)


My research interests lie at the crossroads of mathematics and physics, and I work on such topics as N-body problem in celestial mechanics, Fukaya category in symplectic topology, semiclassical trace formula and resurgence theory. 

More precisely, I am interested in 

* Symplectic Geometry and Symplectic Topology: symplectic reduction; Floer homologies and Fukaya categories; quiver varieties; cluster varieties; singularities from symplectic perspective

* Hamiltonian Systems and Celestial Mechanics: Maslov index; N-body problem (stability; central configurations; periodic orbits); Gutzwiller’s semiclassical trace formula; (algebraic) completely integrable Hamiltonian systems (ACIS) and their interactions with geometry and physics
 
* Mathematical Physics: higher structures (homotopical algebras, higher categories,...) behind quantum mechanics and quantum field theory; quantization (semiclassical, deformation quantization, BV, brane quantization...); modularity; gauge theory; Feynman diagrams  

* Resurgence Theory and Mould Calculus à la Écalle with applications in mathematics (BCH, MZV, modularity...) and quantum physics (wall-crossing, Écalle-Voros exact WKB analysis, complex Chern-Simons theory, topological string theory...)

    > 题目：Symplectic reductions and quantisations 
    > 
    > 摘要：In this talk, we will first review symplectic reductions, geometric quantisation in terms of index theory and  K-theory (K-homology),  and the classical [Q, R] =0 theorems.  In the second part, we will explore the quantum  [Q, R] =0 in symplectic topology with the Q-functor  given by QH and QK from the  gauge  Gromov-Witten theory. This is based on the  long ongoing projects with Bohui Chen and Jianxun Hu, and recent work with Bohui Chen and Hailong Her.
