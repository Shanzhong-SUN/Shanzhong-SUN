### About me

I graduated from [Chern Institute of Mathematics](http://www.cim.nankai.edu.cn), Nankai University, Tianjin and got my PhD degree in 2001.

I spent two years from 2001 to 2003 at School of Mathematical Sciences, Peking University as postdoc.

Then I joined Capital Normal University in 2003 as a faculty member of Department of Mathematics.

Here is my CV (to be added).

### [Research](https://shanzhong-sun.github.io/ShanzhongSUN/research)


My research interests lie at the crossroads of mathematics and physics, and I work on such topics as N-body problem in celestial mechanics, Fukaya category in symplectic topology, semiclassical trace formula and resurgence theory. 

More precisely, I am interested in 

* Symplectic Geometry and Symplectic Topology: symplectic reduction; Floer homologies and Fukaya categories; quiver varieties; cluster varieties; singularities from symplectic perspective

* Hamiltonian Systems and Celestial Mechanics: Maslov index; N-body problem (stability; central configurations; periodic orbits); Gutzwiller’s semiclassical trace formula; (algebraic) completely integrable Hamiltonian systems (ACIS) and their interactions with geometry and physics
 
* Mathematical Physics: higher structures (homotopical algebras, higher categories,...) behind quantum mechanics and quantum field theory; semiclassical/deformation quantization; modularity; gauge theory;  

* Resurgence Theory and Mould Calculus à la Écalle with applications in mathematics (BCH, MZV, modularity...) and quantum physics (wall-crossing, Écalle-Voros exact WKB analysis, complex Chern-Simons theory...)

    > 题目：TBA/WKB correspondence and Resurgent Quantum Mechanics
    > 
    > 摘要：In this talk, we derive a system of thermodynamics Bethe ansatz (TBA) equations governing the exact WKB periods in one-dimensional Quantum Mechanics with arbitrary polynomial potentials. These TBA equations provide a solution to the Riemann-Hilbert problem of WKB periods in resurgent Quantum Mechanics. Combined with the exact quantization condition, our TBA equations provide a powerful method to solve the spectral problem. If time allows, we will also mention recent achievements on the higher order ODE.
